        Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way?
Who are those horrible orange men? And I'm his friend Jesus. Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there!

Oh God, what have I done? THE BIG BRAIN AM W

INNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN! Oh Leela! You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only person who ever loved me.

You guys realize you live in a sewer, right?
Hey, guess what you're accessories to. Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets! Large bet on myself in round one. You know, I was God once. Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money!

Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family.
Who are you, my warranty?!
Oh yeah, good luck with that.
Actually, that's still true.
Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way? Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars. Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial? Ooh, name it after me! Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets?

And from now on you're all named Bender Jr.
You're going back for the Countess, aren't you?
Actually, that's still true.
Guess again. Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer. I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there! Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo!

Hello Morbo, how's the family? Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them. Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?

Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually! Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them? WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT!

What kind of a father would I be if I said no? Why did you bring us here? You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work, but they don't pay you or let you go. And I'm his friend Jesus.

Oh sure! Blame the wizards! Why yes! Thanks for noticing. There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain! I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan! I had more, but you go ahead.

I found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things. The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate. So, how 'bout them Knicks?

But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music. THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN!

These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I'll rest easier not knowing where they are. Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? …To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? …To shreds, you say.

Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it… then perhaps gifts! What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso! Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun?

Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most. Well I'da done better, but it's plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence. Daddy Bender, we're hungry. I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger.

THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN! Throw her in the brig. I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh… also, comes with double prize money.
Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way?
